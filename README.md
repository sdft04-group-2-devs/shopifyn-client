# React Capstone Project
## Overview
This repository contains all the instructions and deliverables for completing your Capstone Project.
### Goal
The purpose of this project is to demonstrate your React skills by building and delivering a complete React application. It's an opportunity to showcase everything you've learned during the program.
### Project Description
The project involves creating an Ecommerce Store where users can purchase furniture and home decor items. The application should include the following sections:
- Home Page
- Product List Page
- Product Detail Page
- Search Results Page
- Shopping Cart Page
- Checkout Page
Instead of providing a specific demo application with predetermined design, you have the freedom to choose and build your own design from scratch. You can find great ideas and inspiration for UI design [here](https://dribbble.com/search/ecommerce).
## Backend Repository
You can find the backend repository for this project [here](https://github.com/sdft04-group-2-devs/shopifyn). Make sure to clone and set up the backend before proceeding with the frontend development.
### Deliverables
The project is divided into multiple deliverables. It's important to plan accordingly and make progress consistently. If you encounter any challenges or get stuck at any point, please schedule a mentoring session to seek timely assistance. Feel free to use the available Slack channel for discussions.
The following are the list of deliverables:
1. Deliverable 1
2. Deliverable 2
3. Deliverable 3
4. Deliverable 4
5. Final Deliverable
### Submitting Your Deliverables
After covering all the requirements and completing the evaluation criteria for each deliverable, follow these steps to submit your project:
1. Push your changes to your branch.
2. Open a pull request (PR) that can be merged into the main branch of your GitHub repository.
   - Include your mentor as a reviewer in the PR.

Prototype and related topics: React Fundamentals & CSS Styles in React
#### Before You Start
Please follow these steps before beginning:
1. Fork this repository into your GitHub account.
2. Ensure your new repository is publicly accessible.
3. Create a new branch named "feat/deliverable1" derived from the main branch of your forked repository.
4. Start working on the requirements specified below.
### Requirements
The following requirements must be met for this deliverable:
1. Create the UI layout for your app, including the following elements:
   1.1. A Header containing the Ecommerce Store logo/name, a search input, and a shopping cart icon. These elements should be disabled for now, focusing only on UI design.
   1.2. The Content view corresponding to the section that will be rendered (in this case, the Home Page).
   1.3. A Footer containing the message "Ecommerce created during Wizelineâ€™s Academy React Bootcamp".
2. Implement the Home Page with the following blocks:
   2.1. A Slider displaying the featured banners from this [mock file](insert_mock_file_link_here).
   2.2. A Carousel or Grid showcasing the product categories from this [mock file](insert_mock_file_link_here).
   2.3. A Grid of Featured Products from this [mock file](insert_mock_file_link_here). Each grid element should display at least the main image of the product, its name, category, and price.
#### Notes
- Minimize the use of third-party libraries, especially those already covered in the Bootcamp. Do not use UI libraries like Bootstrap or Material UI; create your styles from scratch using the learned styling techniques.
- Ensure your UI is responsive, adapting to different screen sizes (smartphone, tablet, and desktop).
- Verify that no warnings or errors are logged in the browser console.
### Evaluation Criteria
The following criteria will be considered for evaluating your deliverable:
- Correct rendering of the Header: 25 points.
- Accurate rendering of the Featured Banners Slider using data from the mock file: 20 points.
- Proper rendering of the Categories Carousel/Grid using data from the mock file: 20 points.
- Correct rendering of the Featured Products Grid using data from the mock file: 30 points.
- Correct rendering of the Footer: 5 points.
#### Bonus
Implement a unit test to validate the appearance of the Ecommerce Store logo/name in the Header: 10 points.
## Deliverable 2
### Goal
Continue working on your Ecommerce Store by adding the Product List Page.
Prototypes and related topics: React lifecycle & Hooks
During this deliverable, you will build the Product List Page for your Ecommerce Store.
Please note that the initial readme provided by you did not mention any prerequisites or setup instructions, hence it's assumed that the environmental setup has already been completed.
If you have any questions or need further clarification, feel free to reach out. Happy coding!
